# 🧠 Focuspond

_A calm productivity app to help you stay focused, organize your tasks, and beat digital overwhelm._

---

## 📖 About the Project

**Focuspond** is a productivity tool that pairs the “Eat The Frog” method with gentle Pomodoro sprints,  
so you can tackle your biggest, hardest tasks first, without burning out.

Designed for makers, creatives, and deep workers, it’s a space to organize your thoughts, track your goals,  
and actually _get things done_ without distractions.

Built using **Next.js**, this is a passion project I'm building in public to help others do their best work.
